<h2>Mini Project Development</h3>

<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Topic: Performance Analysis of SVM algorithm</h4>
Analysis is done in terms of execution_time,memory usage and accuracy of algorithm.

<h3>Contents</h3>
<p>Untitled(4).ipynb contains SVM algorithm code with and without PCA.</p>
<p>Graphs.ipynb contains Comparison plots with respect to SVM algorithm(implemented from scratch,built in library,map-reduce)
<p>Voice Dataset is used for SVM algorithm classification i.e Classify the voices as male or female.
